Solfuzz is an assertion checker for smart contracts written in Solidity. It uses [MythX](https://mythx.io) EVM-level fuzzing and symbolic execution to uncover bugs in the code.

**Solfuzz has been deprecated & its functionality has been integrated into to the [Sabre CLI](https://github.com/b-mueller/sabre).**
